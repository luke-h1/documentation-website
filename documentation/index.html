                <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
  
                  The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
                  
                  Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
                  
                  In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>

                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                            is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                            example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                            its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                        </p> 
                        <br> 
                        <p> 
                         JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                            and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                            structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                            example:
                        </p>
                        <ul> 
                            <br>
                                <p>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                                to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                                client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                                HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                                and page navigation.

                                <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                                relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                                extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                                provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                                the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </p>
